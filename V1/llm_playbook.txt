# Dividend Reconciliation Playbook (Short)
- Small rounding differences (< 0.01 in local currency) are usually harmless and can be accepted or adjusted.
- Larger amount mismatches often stem from incorrect share balances, FX conversions, or special dividend types (e.g., ADR fees).
- Currency mismatches can occur if custodian pays in local currency while internal system expects base currency (or vice versa).
- Missing at Custody: check event confirmation, market holidays, or if the event is paid in multiple tranches.
- Missing at NBIM: the custodian might have an early/later pay-date update; check latest corporate action notifications.
- Withholding tax differences frequently come from residence status, treaty rates, or gross-up rounding.
- Always verify security identifiers (ISIN, local code), ex-/record-/payment dates, and entitled shares.
- For persistent breaks, request the custodian to send SWIFT CA messages or an itemized calculation.
