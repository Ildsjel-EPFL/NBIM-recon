NBIM Dividend Reconciliation Playbook (Concise)
-----------------------------------------------
1) Monetary amounts: treat differences up to +/- 0.01 (in the booking currency) as non-issues. Anything larger requires explanation.
2) Shares/quantities: should match; micro rounding up to 1e-6 can be tolerated only if justified (e.g., fractional entitlements).
3) Dates: EX/RECORD/PAYMENT dates must match exactly once normalized to YYYY-MM-DD.
4) FX & rates: ensure FX math explains amount deltas; quote the applicable FX if used.
5) Common legitimate reasons: rounding, FX conversions, ADR/withholding fees, market-specific tax rates.
6) When escalation is needed: propose concrete next actions and include a short, professional email draft to the custodian (subject + 2–4 sentences).
7) Keep recommendations conservative and auditable.
